  <p class="bible">John 14:1-3 KJV  Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.  (2)  In my Father's house are
  many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.  (3)  And if I go and prepare
  a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

  </p>

  <p class="bible">John 14:17 KJV  Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him:
  but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.

</p>

  <p class="bible" >John 3:16 KJV  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
  not perish, but have everlasting life.

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 2:7 KJV  To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal
life:

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Timothy 2:13-15 KJV  For Adam was first formed, then Eve.  (14)  And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being
deceived was in the transgression.  (15)  Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith
and charity and holiness with sobriety.

  </p>

<p class="bible" >Romans 5:12 KJV  Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all
men, for that all have sinned:

</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 3:23 KJV  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 15:21-22 KJV  For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.  (22)  For as in
Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

</p>

<p class="bible">2 Timothy 1:9-10 KJV  Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according
to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,  (10)  But is now made manifest
by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light
through the gospel:


</p>

<p class="bible">Romans 2:7 KJV  To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal
life:

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Timothy 6:15-16 KJV  Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and
Lord of lords;  (16)  Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath
seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 John 3:13-15 KJV  Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.  (14)  We know that we have passed from death unto
life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.  (15)  Whosoever hateth his brother
is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 15:50-55 KJV  Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither
doth corruption inherit incorruption.  (51)  Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed,  (52)  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead
shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  (53)  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
mortal must put on immortality.  (54)  So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall
have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
 (55)  O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

</p>

<p class="bible">1 Corinthians 15:16-18 KJV  For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:  (17)  And if Christ be not raised,
your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.  (18)  Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 2:25-29 KJV  For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right
hand, that I should not be moved:  (26)  Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh
shall rest in hope:  (27)  Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
corruption.  (28)  Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
 (29)  Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his
sepulchre is with us unto this day.

</p>

<p class="bible">Acts 2:32-36 KJV  This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  (33)  Therefore being by the right hand
of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now
see and hear.  (34)  For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit
thou on my right hand,  (35)  Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  (36)  Therefore let all the house of Israel know
assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.

</p>

<p class="bible">John 11:11-15 KJV  These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that
I may awake him out of sleep.  (12)  Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  (13)  Howbeit Jesus
spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.  (14)  Then said Jesus unto them
plainly, Lazarus is dead.  (15)  And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe;
nevertheless let us go unto him.

</p>

<p class="bible">John 11:21-26 KJV  Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  (22)  But I
know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.  (23)  Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother
shall rise again.  (24)  Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
 (25)  Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall
he live:  (26)  And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?

</p>

<p class="bible">John 11:32-44 KJV  Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him,
Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  (33)  When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also
weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,  (34)  And said, Where have ye laid him? They
said unto him, Lord, come and see.  (35)  Jesus wept.  (36)  Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!  (37)  And
some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not
have died?  (38)  Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
 (39)  Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time
he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.  (40)  Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest
believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?  (41)  Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was
laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.  (42)  And I knew that thou
hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
 (43)  And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.  (44)  And he that was dead came
forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose
him, and let him go.
</p>

<p class="bible">Job 14:1 KJV  Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.

</p>

<p class="bible">Job 14:12-15 KJV  So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised
out of their sleep.  (13)  O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath
be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!  (14)  If a man die, shall he live again? all the
days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.  (15)  Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt
have a desire to the work of thine hands.

</p>

<p class="bible">Job 19:25-27 KJV  For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:  (26) 
And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:  (27)  Whom I shall see for myself,
and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
